    "'''\n",
    "The 'try' and 'except' blocks in Python are used for error handling and exception handling. \n",

    "\n",
    "i)Error Detection: The try block is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception or an error. \n",

    "\n",
    "ii)Exception Handling: The except block, which follows the try block, contains the code that is executed \n",
    "                       if an exception occurs within the try block. It provides a mechanism to handle the exception gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii)Preventing Program Crashes: Using try and except blocks prevents your program from abruptly terminating \n",
    "                                when an exception is raised. Instead of crashing, your program can take appropriate actions, \n",

    "iv)Multiple Except Blocks: You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions. \n",

    "Logging is crucial in software development for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "i)Debugging and Troubleshooting: Logging helps developers identify and diagnose issues in their code. \n",
    "    By logging relevant information, such as variable values, function calls, and error messages, developers \n",
    "    can pinpoint the source of problems more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii)Error Handling: In production environments, errors and exceptions can occur. Logging allows developers \n",
    "    to record details about these errors, including their type and context, which can be invaluable for \n",
    "    diagnosing and fixing issues post-deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii)Monitoring and Maintenance: For long-running applications, logs provide a means to monitor the health \n",
    "    and performance of the software. Developers and system administrators can review logs to detect anomalies, \n",
    "    track usage patterns, and optimize the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv)Security: Logs can be used to record security-related events, such as login attempts, access violations, \n",

    "\n",
    "v)Audit Trails: In many applications, especially those dealing with sensitive data, logs are essential \n",
    "    for creating audit trails. They provide a record of user actions and system events, which can be crucial \n",
    "    for compliance, legal, or regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "vi)Reproducibility: When an issue arises in a production environment, logs can be invaluable for \n",
    "    recreating the problem in a development or testing environment. Developers can use the logged \n",
    "    information to reproduce the issue and debug it effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "vii)Performance Optimization: Logs can help developers identify performance bottlenecks by recording \n",
    "    timestamps and execution times of critical sections of code. This data is useful for optimizing and \n",
    "    fine-tuning an application.\n",
    "\n",

    "#9.What is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python? \n",
    "#When should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Logging and print statements serve different purposes in Python, and the choice between them depends \n",
    "on the specific needs of your application. Here are the key differences between logging and print statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging: Logging is primarily used for recording and managing various types of information and events that \n",
    "    occur during the execution of an application. It's designed for monitoring, debugging, and maintaining \n",
    "    an application over time. Logs can be categorized by severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) \n",
    "    and can be directed to various outputs (e.g., files, console, external services).\n",
    "Print Statements: Print statements are typically used for displaying temporary messages and debugging \n",
    "    information directly to the console. They are often used during development for quick inspection of \n",
    "    variables and program flow.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging: Logging allows you to control the verbosity and destination of log messages. You can specify \n",
    "    different log levels to filter messages, configure different log handlers to send messages to \n",
    "    different destinations (e.g., files, email, databases), and adjust log settings dynamically without modifying the code.\n",
    "Print Statements: Print statements display messages directly to the console, and their behavior \n",
    "    cannot be easily controlled or adjusted without modifying the code. They are generally less flexible \n",
    "    in terms of output destination and formatting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Logging Levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging: Logging provides a range of log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to categorize \n",
    "    messages by severity. This allows you to capture different types of information in the logs and control \n",
    "    which messages are displayed based on their importance.\n",
    "Print Statements: Print statements do not offer different severity levels; all messages are treated equally. \n",
    "    This can make it challenging to distinguish between informational messages and critical error messages.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Persistence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging: Log messages are typically persisted to some form of storage (e.g., log files) and can be retained \n",
    "    for future analysis and troubleshooting.\n",
    "Print Statements: Print statements are transient and are only visible during the execution of the program. \n",
    "    They are not persisted unless redirected to a file.\n",

    "\n",

    "You should use logging over print statements in a real-world application when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Maintainability and Debugging: You want to facilitate long-term maintenance and debugging of the application. \n",
    "    Logs provide a historical record of events that can help identify and diagnose issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Production Use: Your application is deployed in a production environment where print statements are impractical \n",
    "    and may not be visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Granular Control: You need granular control over the level of detail and verbosity of log messages. \n",
    "    Different log levels allow you to capture information relevant to different stages of development and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Error Handling: You want to properly handle and report errors, exceptions, and warnings. \n",
    "    Logging allows you to categorize and prioritize error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Security and Auditing: You need to record security-related events or create audit trails. \n",
    "    Logs can capture user actions and system events for security and compliance purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Centralized Configuration: You want to centralize and configure logging settings (e.g., log rotation, log retention) \n",
    "    across the application without modifying the code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In summary, while print statements are useful for quick debugging during development, logging is essential \n",
    "for real-world applications, especially in production environments, to ensure proper monitoring, debugging, \n",
    "and long-term maintainability. Logging provides the necessary tools to capture, categorize, and manage a wide \n",

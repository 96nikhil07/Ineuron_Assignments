    "#1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize and model complex systems using objects. \n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes that \n",
    "encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). \n",
    "\n",
    "The key goals of OOP include:\n",
    "1.Modularity: Breaking down a complex system into smaller, manageable parts (objects or classes) that can be developed, \n",
    "    tested, and maintained independently.\n",
    "2.Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single \n",
    "    unit (an object or class). This helps hide the internal details and protects data from unauthorized access, \n",
    "    ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "3.Abstraction: Abstracting away complex real-world entities into simplified representations (classes and objects) \n",
    "    that capture essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "4.Inheritance: Allowing one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class \n",
    "    (base class or superclass), facilitating code reuse and promoting the creation of hierarchies of related classes.\n",
    "5.Polymorphism: Enabling objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, which \n",
    "    simplifies code and allows flexibility in handling different types of objects.\n",
    "6.Reusability: Promoting code reusability through class libraries and the ability to inherit and extend existing classes, \n",
    "    reducing redundancy and development time.\n",
    "7.Maintainability: Facilitating easier maintenance and updates to software systems by isolating changes within \n",
    "    specific classes or objects and reducing the risk of unintended side effects.\n",
    "8.Scalability: Supporting the growth and evolution of software systems by allowing new classes and objects to be \n",
    "    added without affecting existing code.\n",

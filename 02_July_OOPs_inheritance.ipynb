    "#1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class \n",
    "(called the subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class \n",
    "(called the superclass or base class). Inheritance enables code reuse, abstraction, and the creation \n",
    "of a hierarchy of classes, making it a powerful mechanism in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are key points about inheritance and why it is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Code Reuse: Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class, \n",
    "    inheriting its attributes and methods. This promotes code reuse because you can use the functionality \n",
    "    of the existing class without duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Hierarchy and Organization: Inheritance allows you to model a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses \n",
    "    inherit common characteristics from their superclass. This hierarchy can represent real-world \n",
    "    relationships and provide a structured way to organize classes in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Abstraction: Inheritance enables abstraction, which means you can define a general (abstract) \n",
    "    class with common features and behaviors, and then create more specific subclasses with specialized features. \n",
    "    The abstract class serves as a blueprint for the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Inheritance is often used in conjunction with polymorphism, another OOP concept. \n",
    "    Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. \n",
    "    This simplifies code and allows for more flexible and generic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Efficiency: Inheritance can lead to more efficient code maintenance. \n",
    "    If you need to make changes or enhancements to a shared behavior, you only need to modify the \n",
    "    code in one place (the superclass), and the changes will apply to all subclasses that inherit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Simplicity: Inheritance can make your code more readable and intuitive. \n",
    "    When you design your classes using inheritance, you model real-world relationships and hierarchies, \n",
    "    which can make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",

    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "->Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented programming where a class \n",
    "can inherit attributes and methods from only one superclass (base class). In other words, \n",
    "a subclass can have only one immediate parent class. This is a straightforward and simple form of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "i)Simplicity: Single inheritance is conceptually simple and easy to understand. \n",
    "    It creates a linear hierarchy of classes, making the code structure clear and intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii)Avoiding Diamond Problem: Single inheritance helps avoid the \"Diamond Problem,\" \n",
    "    which can occur in multiple inheritance (explained below). In the Diamond Problem, \n",
    "    there can be ambiguity when two or more superclasses have the same method or attribute names.\n",
    "'''\n",

    "\n",
    "'''    \n",
    "->Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class can inherit attributes and methods \n",
    "from more than one superclass (base class). This means a subclass can have multiple immediate parent classes. \n",
    "While it provides flexibility, it can lead to complexity and potential issues like the Diamond Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "i)Code Reuse: Multiple inheritance allows a subclass to inherit features from multiple superclasses, \n",
    "    promoting code reuse. This can reduce the need to duplicate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii)Flexibility: Multiple inheritance can model complex relationships and scenarios where a class \n",
    "    should inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources. It provides more flexibility in \n",
    "    designing class hierarchies.\n",

    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "i)Number of Superclasses: The main difference is in the number of superclasses a subclass can have. \n",
    "    Single inheritance allows only one superclass, while multiple inheritance allows multiple superclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii)Ambiguity: Multiple inheritance can lead to ambiguity when two or more superclasses provide conflicting \n",
    "    method or attribute names. This is known as the \"Diamond Problem\" and can complicate code resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii)Complexity: Multiple inheritance, due to its flexibility, can lead to more complex code and class hierarchies. \n",
    "    Debugging and maintenance may become more challenging.\n",

    "2.Private Access Modifier:\n",
    "    Private members are restricted to the class in which they are defined and cannot be accessed from outside the class.\n",
